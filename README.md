Update Free Software Foundation address to latest. This is to get rid of the rpmlint error. This only supposed to be done by the upstream, but I'm not sure how having the correct address would affect the legal standing of the notice. But I'm not a lawyer, or even a lawyer's son, so use at your discresion.
